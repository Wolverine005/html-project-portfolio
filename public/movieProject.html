    <h4>Storyline</h4>
    <p>
      Earth's future has been riddled by disasters, famines, and droughts. There
      is only one way to ensure mankind's survival: Interstellar travel. A newly
      discovered wormhole in the far reaches of our solar system allows a team
      of astronauts to go where no man has gone before, a planet that may have

    <h3>Chappie</h3>
    <h4>Storyline</h4>
    <p>
      In Johannesburg, the police department reduced the high rating of
      criminality using robots from the Tetravaal Company, designed by the
      engineer Deon Wilson. The former military Vincent Moore is envious of
      Deon, since he has developed another project called Moose, but neither
      Tetravaal nor the police department is interested. Deon has just developed
      an Artificial Intelligence but the Tetravaal's CEO Michelle Bradley asks
      him to abort the project. Deon decides to bring the damaged Robot 22 that
      was sent to be crushed to test his A.I. However he is kidnapped by the
      criminals Ninja, Yo-Landi and Amerika that want him to stop the robot
      cops. When they see the damaged robot in the van, they force Deon to
      program it to heist banks with them and they call it Chappie. However,
      Chappie acts like a child and need to be trained to learn and grow.
      Meanwhile Vincent follows Deon and plots an evil scheme to activate his
      robot.

    <h3>The Notebook</h3>
    <h4>Storyline</h4>
    <p>
      With almost religious devotion, Duke, a kind octogenarian inmate of a
      peaceful nursing home, reads daily a captivating story from the worn-out
      pages of his leather-bound notebook to a fellow female patient. To keep
      her company, Duke recounts the fascinating love affair between impecunious
      but poetic country boy Noah and Allie, an affluent city girl. And little
      by little, Duke unfolds a Southern, lumber-scented summer romance beneath
      the tall trees of late 1930s North Carolina. Indeed, it seems as if the
      silent manuscript possesses the unfathomable power to penetrate the opaque
      clouds that enclose the silver-haired dame; slowly but surely, the
      enchanted lady becomes immersed in the strangely alluring fairy tale of
      the young ardent lovers' highs and lows. But nobody knows what tomorrow
      holds. Are all summer loves doomed to fail?
